# Natural-Language-Processing-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims at using natural language processing techniques to understand tweets about self-driving cars. A set of tweets will be analyzed and we can find the words in the tweets that are most predictive of positive, neutral or negative sentiments about self-driving cars

## Data
Dataset is provided as Twitter-sentiment-self-drive-DFE.csv

## Code
Code is provided as sentiment analysis-self driving car.ipynb

## Tasks preformed in the code 
1) Conducted exploratory data analysis: summary statistics and histograms on the numeric fields; dealing with null values and abnormal values
2) Tokenized the Tweets for analysis
3) Showed the most common words/tokens overall, nouns, adjectives, and punctuation-based tokens for all of the tweets
4) Created a model to predict what sentiment a Tweet will be given on the 1-5 scale
5) Generated 10 top words/tokens for each sentiment rating
5) Evaluated how well the model performs for each rating (1-5) and how to improve the existing moodel
